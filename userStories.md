Tester:
As a tester, I can see all of my options clearly and at the same size so I can accurately make choices.
As a tester, it is obvious where I am supposed to click and how to make a selection, so I don't lose interest and focus.

Researcher:

As a developer, I want clear and succinct variable and function names just in case someone else needs to figure it out.
As a developer, I want to come up with a clear plan so I can limit my aimlessness while coding.
