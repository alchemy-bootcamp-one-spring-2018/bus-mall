## As a developer...
* I'd like to use a constructor function to reuse my code and make my JavaScript easier to change.
* I'd like to make an array of objects that slices out the object (and its accompanying image) so that it doesn't get duplicated within the trio.
* I'd like to use the DOM tree and separate my components from their data so that the app is as easy to change as possible.
* I'd like to scope the state as narrow as possible and make sure that shared states belong to a common ancestor, in order to make the app easy to change or adjust.

## As a focus group participant...
* I'd like to be able to see three unique images at a time on the page so that I can choose from one of them.
* I'd like it to be clear how I can choose the images, whether it's by having a radio selection below each image and then submitting or by simply clicking on the image - whichever it is, I'd like it to be obvious.
* I'd like to be presented with images of some interesting products!
* I'd like to be on a webpage that's pleasant to look at - that displays the images and all the other content in a visually pleasing way.

## As a market researcher...
* I'd like to make sure that the focus group participant has no trouble accessing and using the app survey.
* I'd like to make sure the app presents three unique images that are presented objectively and equally (at least, as objectively as possible - images are similar size, etc).
* I'd like to see a report/summary at the end of the survey that tells me clearly how many times each picture was displayed and how many times it was clicked on.
* I'd like to see this all displayed on a visually slick webpage!

Not asking for much, huh?
