# User Stories
## Marketing Research Team

* As a marketing research user, I want the application/feature to:
  * Show the focus group 3 images side-by-side
  * Have group members choose which product they would be most likely to purchase
  * Store the data, calculate the results, and visually display the data to the user after a minimum of 25 clicks
  * Track not only the number of clicks for each item but also calculate the percentage of times it was clicked (relative to number of times shown)

## Developer

* As a developer, I would like the application/feature to:
  * Meet the required functionality for the marketing team to gain their data insight
  * Leave enough room in the design to change variables (modify components or add new ones)
  * Cleanly display the returned data to the user


## Focus Group

* As a focus group user, I would like the application/web page to:
  * Be clear in the instructions
  * Show quality photos with appropriate design elements to illustrate the products
  * Function seamlessly so that my selections are easily identified
  * Show the results in a way that is clear and legible
