# Personas/User Roles and User Stories
## Personas (user roles)
1. **Marketing Research Team** - members are interested in which products customers are most likely to purchase. They intend to determine this by way of an application that will present product photos to customers, three at a time, and asking the focus group participants to vote for the product they are most likely to purchase, by clicking on a image. Marketing wants to know how many products have been clicked on, how may votes each product gets and how many times each product has been shown. They need to collect at least 25 votes before a data report will be made available.
1. **Developer** - members of the development team are tasked with writing the functions that will make it possible for marketing to achieve their goals, while delivering the easiest possible user experience to the Focus Group Participants.
1. **Focus Group Participant** - a Focus Group Participant will vote for their favorite product out of a selection of three products, selected randomly from the entire catalog of potential BusMall products. They will view products in sets of three - once a product is clicked on, a new set of products will be displayed. Products may appear more than once, but never more than once in one group. Focus Group Participants may vote for a product more than once, if it is displayed to them multiple times.
