# Bus Mall Marketing App 

## User Stories

### Market Research Team (The Client)

- As a market researcher I want to present focus group participants with a selection of our products so they can vote on which they are most likely to purchase.

- As a market researcher I want the products presented to be random with no duplicates for each choice instance so we can evaluate the broadest number of products. 

- As a market researcher I want to hide the results of the focus group users votes until they have voted 25 times to keep their judgment neutral. 

- As a market researcher I want to track the number of clicks and percentage of times a product was clicked when shown in order to determine the most popular products overall. 


### Focus Group Participant

- As a focus group participant I want to see a range of product images that Bus Mall offers so I can select the one I am most likely to purchase. 

- As a focus group participant I want instructions for how to vote with the app so it is clear and easy to use.

- As a focus group participant I want to be presented with a new set of products to vote on after I make a vote for a product. 

- As a focus group participant I want to see which products I voted for when I have reached the end of the cycle of products being presented to me. 

### Developer

- As the developer I want to present the focus group participant with 3 randomized product images at a time so they can click to vote on the product they would likely purchase. 

- As the developer I want to track which products have been voted for, how many times they were voted for, and how many time the participant was presented with the product during their session so I can report those metrics back to the market researchers.

- As a developer I want to end the users voting session after 25 votes and display their metrics so they can see their session results. 

- As a developer I want the design to make it clear to the user how to use the app and present the metrics in a useful way so the market researchers can get the data they need.
