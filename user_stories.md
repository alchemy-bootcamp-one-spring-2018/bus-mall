As a Market Researcher:

I'd like to know the total number of clicks

I'd like to know the percentage of times an item was clicked to gauge focus group interest in each displayed product

I'd like to know how many times each image was displayed

I'd like the layout and instructions to be simple and intuitive to help guarantee participation

I don't want any repetition of images within the same instance



As a Focus Group Participant:

I want something quick and easy to use with an understandable layout

I want to be able to see images of 3 Bus-mall products at a time

I want to be able to click on each image to vote

I don't want to see any repetition of images within the same instance



As a Developer:

I would like to create a clear and intuitive layout

I would like to select three random photos from the image directory of Bus-mall products and display them side-by-side-by-side in the browser window.

I would like to make sure the 3 images of Bus-mall products are randomly displayed without repetition in the same instance or the immediate next instance.

I would like to make sure the images are the same size.

I would like to be able to receive clicks on those displayed images, and track those clicks for each image

I would like to make sure the number of clicks and percentages of clicks per image are tracked.

I would like to make sure that the info is presented visually on the page but ONLY AFTER 25 total clicks

I would like that after 25 selections have been made, to turn off the event listeners on the images (to prevent additional voting) and also display a list of the products with votes received with each list item
