Bus Mall: Start up company

Bus mall started out with two struggling divorcees on a bus who were tired of the boredom and minor annoyances of a commute, completely devoid of online shopping. With bitter minds, and a few dozen beers later, they came up with the ingenious idea to compile data from commuters that will be helpful to small companies trying to bring their product to market. Bus mall would like to be the first to present an on commute fun survey!

User: Portland metro area

The people in this area have thier finger on the pulse of what is hip and trendy in todays world! If any product is going to make it out there, who better to see it than the people who are a part of making what is cool... cool. The commuters will be tasked with voting for thier favorite products as they are shown them on a new on-commute app called Bus Mall!
