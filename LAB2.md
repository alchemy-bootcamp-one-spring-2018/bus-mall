# Bus Mall Multi-Page, Local Storage and Charting

## Multiple Pages

Marketing has decided not to put the results on the same page as the voting. Split the app into two pages, `index.html` which is the current voting functionality and `report.html` which displays the statistics (and the chart from part 2).

There is no longer a requirement to wait for 25 clicks, the report can be viewed at any time. But, the user should stop voting after 25 clicks.

Data should be consistent as you move between the two pages.

Also, on the report page, add a button to clear the data.

## Charting

Your savvy marketing person has just informed you that just showing users the numbered data of the click percentages is not going to cut it.

You need a visual representation to grab the user's attention.

### Add Charting

Using ChartJS, display your vote totals in a bar chart as instructed in the initial definition of the BusMall assignment. If you want to try some additional chart types, do so with some of your alternate data that you have calculated from your vote results. The size and look of your chart is up to you, just be sure to put it in the area beneath the three images. Hint: for this type of data, bar charts work well. You could also play with charting to display both the vote count and the number of views.
