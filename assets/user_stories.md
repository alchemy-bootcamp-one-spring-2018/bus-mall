# User Stories

## the marketing research team

As a marketing research team member, I need: 

1. to know which products are the most popular overall so that I can make good marketing decisions
2. to have the application show a specified number of images at once, so that I can comparer relative popularity.
3. to keep track of how many times a picture was presented, and out of that, how many times it was chosen.
4. to have the app hide the user's responses until after they have finished making 25 choices so that the user is not influenced by their prior decisions.

## the developer

As a developer, I need: 

1. to be able to quickly change the number of images displayed in case marketing changes its mind.
2. to be able to easily add new images to the file as marketing finds new products to try.
3. to be able to easily change how many decisions the user is required to make before they are finished, in case marketing wants to vary the length of the focus sessions.

## the focus group participant

As a focus group participant, I need: 

1. the screen to display clear instructions so that I know what to do.
2. the images to be large enough for me to fully discern the features of the product so that I know what to buy.
3. to not see a history of my responses so that I am not influenced by my prior decisions.
4. to clearly indicate when my task is finished.
